         <h2 class="blog-title">Safe-Haven Assets</h2>
         <p>Safe-haven assets are financial instruments that retain or increase in value during periods of market turbulence. These assets act as a form of insurance, offering stability or even potential profits when other investments falter. Perhaps the most well-known traditional examples include gold and government bonds. Throughout history, gold has proven itself to be a trusted store of value, with its value often rising during economic recessions. Likewise, government bonds, especially from stable governments like the U.S., are considered safe because they are backed by a guarantee of repayment from a credible issuer.</p>
         <p>In the digital era, some cryptocurrencies have begun to position themselves as a potential safe-haven asset class. Digital assets such as bitcoin operate on a decentralized network, making them immune to government interference – an appealing factor during times of economic uncertainty. Despite periods of extreme volatility and spectacular price corrections, bitcoin’s overall trajectory has been upward for its entire history, sparking interest in it as a potential long-term store of value to hedge against inflation and market volatility. This is why BTC is sometimes referred to as “digital gold,” highlighting its shared characteristics with the historically most widely used safe-haven asset. </p>

            <li>Conducted user research and usability testing to inform the redesign of a healthcare provider's website, resulting in a 15% increase in website traffic</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 class="blog-title">How Is Crypto Different?</h2>
         <p>This vision is why we have seen the emergence of a wide array of cryptocurrencies, each experimenting with traditional financial mechanics in their own way and attempting to improve upon them. A common defining characteristic is the interplay between inflationary and deflationary dynamics. Note that the terms ‘inflationary’ and ‘deflationary’ here regard changes in coin supply rather than changes in price, as in traditional economic usage.</p>
